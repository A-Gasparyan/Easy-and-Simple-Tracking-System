# Easy and Simple Tracking System (ESTraS)


ESTraS is a software designed to track up to 4 arenas, each containing a single animal, within pre-recorded videos. This software is specifically designed for conducting behavioral tests in a user-friendly manner.

ESTraS offers you the opportunity to conduct these experiments without the need for a powerful computer, programming knowledge, or a significant financial investment.

Additionally, it provides valuable insights through an Extras module â€“ a dedicated feature for unsupervised clustering of animal trajectories and angles.


# Instalation

## Windows:
ESTraS is a standalone, Python-based executable. This means that you only need to unzip the file and click on 'ESTraS.exe' to run the application.

## Linux:
It is possible to use ESTraS with WineHQ. We have tested it on Ubuntu 20.04 and Linux Mint 20 with WineHQ version 8.0.

## Mac OS:
While we have not yet tested ESTraS on Mac OS, it should function similarly to the Linux version for users on this platform. 
Please inform us if you are able to use it.
